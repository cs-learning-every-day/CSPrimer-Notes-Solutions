# Learning how to better use man pages
- You can run `man man` for info on man pages
- There are sections to the manual
    - By running `man (section) (command)` you can specify which section you want to look at
- `apropos` (or `man -k`) can be used to search for a command
- `less`
    - The default viewer for man pages
    - How to look up keybindings (press `h` while in `less`)
- Gotcha
    - Things on the command line are not always a program executed on the command line (i.e. in section 1))
    - Example -> `ls`
        - A general utility, which is in `/usr/bin/ls`
    - Example -> `cd`
        - Not a general utility, its a builtin
        - By running man page on cd you'll get the page for builtin
- `man bash` for bash stuff

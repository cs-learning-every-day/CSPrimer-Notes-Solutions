For further practice working with binary encodings of data, in this problem you'll write a program that can rotate an image. The exercise files contain an image called teapot.bmp. The output of your program should match rotated.bmp. You can check this using the diff program: although the output won't make much sense if there is a difference, an exact match will result in no output from diff as well as a 0 return code. As usual, you should watch the first section of the video for more context, and ask questions below or on Discord if you get stuck. You may also find it worthwhile to set small milestones for yourself as I do in the video, e.g. first try to parse the first byte or two, next parse the width of the image, perhaps next determine the colors of the first pixel, etc. Good luck!

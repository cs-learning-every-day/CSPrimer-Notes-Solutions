A TCP SYN flood is a denial-of-service attack where TCP handshakes are initiated but not completed. In this problem, you will analyze a simulation of a TCP SYN flood by parsing a packet capture file.

Please watch the first section of the video for more context on what this involves, and if these concepts are new you may wish to also continue watching through "Planning and hints". The strategy I lay out there is to proceed through the following parsing steps:

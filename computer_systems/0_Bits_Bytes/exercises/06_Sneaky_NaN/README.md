IEEE 754 is a substantial and intentionally designed system for working with floating point values, but it comes with some surprising features! In this problem, you'll exploit the encoding of NaN ("not a number") in IEEE floating point to hide and extract a secret message. Specifically, you should write two functions conceal and extract, such that: conceal can be invoked with a short string (hint: as many as 6 bytes) and the returned value is and behaves identically to a NaN. However, invoking extract with that same value reveals the original message. e.g. in Python, you should see: >>> x = conceal('hello!') >>> x nan >>> type(x) <class 'float'> >>> x + 5 nan >>> x / 2 nan >>> x += 3 >>> x nan >>> extract(x) 'hello!' Don't use something tricky like storing the value elsewhere and referencing it: the objective is to solve this through understanding the IEEE 754 bit packing scheme. As usual, watch the first section of the video for more context. The subsequent section "Hints and planning" basically lays out the scheme for you, so should be considered a huge spoiler, but of course there is still value in implementing the plan yourself. If you do decide to watch "Hints and planning" too. Good luck!

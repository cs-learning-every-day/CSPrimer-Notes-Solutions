# Cache Line
- Going to RAM is much slower than doing compute
    - Adding two numbers in RAM takes much longer than CPU cache
- CPU Cache
    - RAM 
        - Series of bytes
    - CPU caches will pull in "cache lines"
        - Generally 64 bytes of the RAM 
            - On some Macs, maybe 128 bytes
        - Will allow you to cache 16 4 byte integers
            - Iterating over them iteratively would give you good cache utilization
- CPU Cache vs. RAM Performance
    - Cache -> 1 nanosecond
    - RAM   -> 50-100 nanoseconds

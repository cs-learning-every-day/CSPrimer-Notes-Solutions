In this problem, you will make your terminal beep. It should also convince you that even ASCII is a binary encoding, and incidentally expose you to some concepts related to the tty interface. You know you have succeeded if you can run a program that you wrote, and when you press a number key (e.g. "3") your terminal should beep that many times. Other inputs should have no result. Ideally you should be able to terminate your program with a SIGINT (^C for most people) and your terminal should not be borked afterwards. If you run into surprising issues and are using a fancy terminal emulator, you may want to try using another, such as Terminal.app on MacOS. Some minor hints: ASCII has a bell character ðŸ”” You may need to change your terminal control mode in your program, in order to read keystrokes directly

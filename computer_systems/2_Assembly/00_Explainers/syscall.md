- System Call
    - Kind of like a function that the operating system itself exposes
    - To expose functionality that should be protected in some way
        - We don't want user written programs to interact with this functionality directly
        - Should be disintermediated by Operating System
            - The OS evaluates whether you have permissions for this action
- Example
    - Read from a file on disk
        - User program shouldn't be able to do this (even in Assembly)
        - Should explicitly ask the OS
            - I.e. the SYS_read (3) call
- System Calls can be found:
    - /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/sys/syscall.h

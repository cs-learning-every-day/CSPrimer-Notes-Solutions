# Computer Architecture / Instruction Set / Microarchitecture
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) -> Specification
    - Design of the interface exposed by a CPU
    - Intel and AMD used the same instruction set architecture 
        - Called AMD64
    - Defines the machine code a processor reads and acts upon, as well as 
        - Word Size
        - Memory Address modes
        - Processor Registers
        - Data Type
- Microarchiteture (uarch) -> Implementation
    - Implementation of the ISA
    - Often designed to be minimally visible to the programmer 
        - In some cases kept secret
    - Intel and AMD have very different microarchitectures for the same ISA
- Computer Architecture
   - General term for the design of the CPU, encapsulating the ISA, uarch and potentially broader aspects of CPU design

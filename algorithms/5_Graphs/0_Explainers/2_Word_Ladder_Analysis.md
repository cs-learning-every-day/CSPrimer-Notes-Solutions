## Asymptotic Analysis of Word Ladder Problem
- Worst Case is probably not so interesting here
    - The worst case is the length of the word list
    - You're saying that you end up with a cluster of words that are all connected to each other
        - It takes a lot of words to get there
        - Also it has to be a word that's connected to your starting word
- In practice, not all words are connected to one another
- Someone had investigated long word ladder chains
    - About 20 links is the maximum according to one researcher
- So the average case is more likely to be interesting
    - Given that your runtime is dependent on the data and their relationship to each other
- Figuring out the average case empirically:
    - Average degree (no of neighbors) is x
    - Average path length is y
- In practice, doing worst case is going to depend on how critical it is to be under some lower bound
    - You want to do this so that you know it's going to be fast enough to meet your constraint
- For a web service, you want to probably do average case
- Average case here
    - Average degree (no of neighbors) is 10
    - Average path length is 5
    - Average case: 10^1 + 10^2 + 10^3 + 10^4 + 10^5 = 111,110

- Asymptotic Analysis of creating the new string in Python
    - `word[:i] + chr(c) + word[i+1:]`
    - This is O(1), provided that Python is using a memory as backing for the word
- Asymptotic Analysis of get_neighbors
    - O(n * m) where n is the length of the word list and m is the length of the word

- In practice, good to get to real terms
    - We can only run this over 4 or 5 character strings
        - At 6 characters, it's going to take too long - Knuth has shown this

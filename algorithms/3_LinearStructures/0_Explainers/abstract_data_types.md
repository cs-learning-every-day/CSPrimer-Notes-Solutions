# Abstract Data Types
- Stack
    - The definition of a stack is in terms of its behavior
        - The methods it exposes (push, pop, peek, count)
    - It doesn't necessarily dictate how it must be implemented
- Barbara Liskov is behind a lot of the theory behind this
- Maps
    - Hash Maps
    - Tree Maps
    - The ADT doesn't necessarily say anything about performance
